                     As breeders and lovers of dogs, we always strive to produce the best and healthiest Bullmastiff
                    puppies which meet the breed standards.  We do this by only selecting great studs and dams that lead
                    us to believe they will produce healthy babies for loving families to enjoy. However, please
                    remember that we are working with live animals that may develop illnesses common to the breed or
                    viral infections that can be found anywhere in the environment, and even sometimes congenital
                    illnesses that may have been present in either bloodline several generations back. Unfortunately,
                    when buying/selling a puppy we can never be 100% sure of the puppy’s health until he/she is examined
                    by a veterinarian. For this reason and for your peace of mind, Clinton's Bullmastiff Home offers a
                    one-year limited health guarantee on all of our Bullmastiff puppies for sale. 

                    You must have your puppy examined by a licensed veterinarian of your choice within seven (7)
                    business days of receiving your puppy. If your puppy, in the opinion of the veterinarian, has any
                    physical problems considered to be life threatening, we will provide you with a healthy replacement
                    puppy of equal value. If there are no puppies available, one will be provided from the next
                    available litter whelped. If you choose a puppy of greater value, then you will be responsible for
                    the cost difference. To make a claim, you must return the puppy back to Clinton's Bullmastiff Home
                    within seven (7) days of the vet check. Also, include a signed statement from the veterinarian
                    providing the date of the examination and an explanation as to why the puppy's health is at risk.
                    The statement must include a description of the symptoms supporting the opinion of the veterinarian.
                    There will be no refund on shipping charges. Should the puppy die of a birth defect within one year
                    of the time of purchase, Clinton's Bullmastiff Home will provide a replacement puppy. To qualify for
                    this guarantee, you must have kept the puppy under the care of a licensed veterinarian. The care
                    must include all vaccinations recommended by the veterinarian. 

                    To make a claim, you must provide a signed statement from the veterinarian including the cause of
                    death and a copy of ALL of your puppy's health records. If there are no puppies available, one will
                    be provided from the next available litter whelped. 

                    Failure to have the puppy examined within seven (7) days of purchase, VOIDS ALL GUARANTEES. Under no
                    condition will we replace a puppy, where we are not advised of it's being ill beforehand, or "put to
                    sleep" without our permission. 

                    Note: This health guarantee does not apply to the following: alopecia, hypoglycemia, cherry eye,
                    entropion, giardia, internal/external parasites, coccidian (coccidiosis), kennel cough, parvo,
                    distemper, allergies, viral/bacterial infections, mites, fleas, ticks. ALL types of mange, physical
                    problems which is or could be the result of an injury, collapsing trachea, hernias, non-descending
                    testicles, open fontanels, hip dysplasia or any other disease or health condition that is
                    treatable. 


                    Note: If a puppy is being returned for any health guarantee claim, you must also return all
                    registration papers. Registration papers must be signed, transferring ownership back to Clinton's
                    Bullmastiff Home

                    Note: All sales are final, and Clinton's Bullmastiff Home will not be held responsible for any costs
                    accrued after the sale. 

                    Note: NO REFUNDS AND ALL DEPOSITS & PAYMENTS ARE NON REFUNDABLE
